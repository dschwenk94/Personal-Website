I need to add actual screenshots from the Sling TV mobile app to this directory.

The two images needed are:
1. The Sling TV app download screen (seen in the first PDF)
2. The Sling TV mobile interface with LiveNOW from FOX (seen in the second PDF)

Since I wasn't able to programmatically extract these images, you'll need to:
1. Take screenshots from the provided PDFs
2. Save them to this directory as:
   - sling-download.jpg (or .png)
   - sling-mobile.jpg (or .png)

After adding these images, update the imports in the ProjectsPage.js file to use these actual images.
